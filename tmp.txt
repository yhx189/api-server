Two IP addressess are not passed as input.
Usage: ../king/bin/king [-c count] [-d dir] IP_Address1 IP_Address2

 Where count = number of query packets sent, the larger the better, default count = 4 (strongly advised), min 2 
 dir = f for IP_Address1 to IP_Address2 only and  dir = b for either direction, Default dir = b
Example:
../king/bin/king -c 5 -d f 128.95.4.1 128.95.2.67

Latency is estimated between 227.8.105.129.in-addr.arpa. and 209.182.124.165.in-addr.arpa.
